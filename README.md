# REPI_microscope
Python control code for the 'ASI RAMM epi' (REPI) microscope.

## Key features:
A fast and flexible 2D fluorescence microscope. This microscope is physically mobile and relatively easy to modify or re-configure.
- **Primary objectives**: 10x, 20x and 40x air (more can be added).
- **XY field of view**: variable between ~200x200um to ~2000x2000um.
- **Excitation**: fast LEDs at 395/25, 440/20, 470/24, 510/25, 550/15 and 640/30 (nm).
- **Emission**: fast filter wheel with FF01-432/36, FF01-515/30, FF01-595/31, FF01-698/70 and FF01-432/515/595/730 filters.
- **Course/fine focus**: automated z drive.
- **XY stage**: automated lead screw.
- **Z stacks**: fast piezo.
- **Autofocus**: hardware based.
- **Incubation**: stage top temperature and CO2 can be used.
- **Control**: basic GUI and open source API in Python.
